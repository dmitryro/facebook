### 1. Longest Palindromic Substring
   
   **LeetCode No: 5**
   
   Given a string `s`, return longest palintromic substring in `s`.

### 2. Subarray Sum Equals K
   
   **LeetCode No: 560**

   Given an array of integers `nums` and integer `k`, return *the total number of
   continuous subarrays whos sum equals to `k`.

### 3. Random Pick with Weight

   **LeetCode No: 528**

   You are given an array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of ith index (0-indexed).

We need to call the function pickIndex() which randomly returns an integer in the range [0, w.length - 1]. pickIndex() should return the integer proportional to its weight in the w array. For example, for w = [1, 3], the probability of picking the index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e 75%).

More formally, the probability of picking index i is w[i] / sum(w).


### 4. Restore IP Addresses
   
   ** LeetCode No: 93**
    
   Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be obtained from s. You can return them in any order.

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers, each integer is between 0 and 255, separated by single dots and cannot have leading zeros. For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses and "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.
